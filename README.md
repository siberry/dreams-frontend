# DreamCatchr

This is "DreamCatchr" a web app which allows users to track their dreams and explore potential interpretations, read dreams of other users and follow users. The live frontend is available at https://dreamcatchr.herokuapp.com/. It was built with React, Ruby on Rails, Nokogiri, the Artsy API.

The dream interpretations were scraped from https://cafeausoul.com, modified slightly, and paired with surreal imagery queried from the Artsy API. The DreamCatchr dream tags JSON can be found at https://majestic-canyonlands-27127.herokuapp.com/dream_tags.

Enjoy!
